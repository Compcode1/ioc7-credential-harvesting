Conclusion / README
Case Title: IOC 7 – HR Email Phish with Fake Login Portal
Primary Threat: Credential harvesting via impersonated HR communication
Triage Type: Social Engineering / Obfuscated Link
Detection Vector: Secure Web Gateway domain categorization anomaly
Key Response Actions: Domain analysis, credential reset, domain block
Lessons Learned:

Even well-written phishing emails can bypass standard defenses.

Users must be trained to spot subtle signs of fakes.

Monitoring newly registered domains and uncategorized traffic is essential.

The attack surface includes employee trust—not just endpoints and ports.

This project exemplifies how quiet attacks on human behavior can be just as dangerous as malware-based intrusions. A solid social engineering triage protocol—and fast response—prevented credential loss in this case.
